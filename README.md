# 3D-Modeling: The Canonic Donut

There are different 3D modeling tools, but the one that we are using is **Blender** - an open source tool that can be downloaded through [this link](https://blender.org).

To start with Blender and create a first model (a donut), [this canonic video series](https://youtube.com/watch?v=nIoXOplUvAw&list=PLjEaoINr3zgFX8ZsChQVQsuDSjEqdWMAD&index=2) was followed. It will cover all 3 basic pillars of 3D (modeling, texturing and lighting), as well as some explanation about the basics of animation and rendering.

This repo also contains a `.gltf` file of the donut, to be used inside Microsoft's Altspace.

See the final animation of the donut below:
